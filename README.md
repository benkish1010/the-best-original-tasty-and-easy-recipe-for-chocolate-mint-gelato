Chocolate Mint Gelato (Authentic, Easy, Home Ice-Cream-Maker)
Target yield

About 1 quart / 1 liter (depends on your machine + overrun)

Ingredients (metric is best)

Base

600 g whole milk

200 g heavy cream (35%+)

150 g sugar

4 egg yolks (about 75–85 g)

25–35 g fresh mint leaves (stems removed, washed + dried)

1/4 tsp fine salt

Chocolate

35–45 g unsweetened cocoa powder (Dutch-process is great)

80–120 g dark chocolate (60–70%), chopped

Optional: 50 g mini chocolate chips for “stracciatella” pieces

Why this is “gelato-ish”: more milk than cream, lower fat, and you churn with less air so it’s denser.

Step-by-step (with temps + timing)
1) Infuse the mint (10–15 min)

In a pot, combine milk + cream + mint leaves.

Heat until steaming (don’t boil). Turn off heat.

Cover and steep 10 minutes (taste after 10; go to 15 if you want stronger mint).

Strain out mint (press gently—don’t pulverize, or it can go “grassy”).

2) Add cocoa + melt chocolate (5 min)

Whisk in sugar + cocoa + salt while the mix is still warm so cocoa dissolves smoothly.

Add chopped dark chocolate and stir until melted (gentle heat if needed).

3) Temper the eggs + cook custard (8–12 min)

In a bowl, whisk egg yolks.

Slowly ladle in some hot chocolate-mint dairy while whisking (tempering).

Pour back into the pot. Cook on medium-low, stirring constantly, until it reaches 82–84°C (180–183°F) and lightly coats a spoon.

4) Chill hard (4+ hours)

Strain (optional but recommended for ultra-smooth texture).

Cool quickly (ice bath), then refrigerate at least 4 hours, ideally overnight.

5) Churn (15–30 min) + add chips

Churn in your ice cream maker until soft-serve consistency (15–30 min, machine dependent).

Add chips/mini chunks in the last 1–2 minutes.

6) Set + serve like gelato

Freeze 2–4 hours to firm.

Serve a bit warmer than ice cream (let it sit 5–10 minutes before scooping) so flavors pop and texture stays silky.

Tips for “pro” results (still simple)

Don’t use peppermint extract as the main mint flavor—fresh mint tastes more “real” and less harsh. 
Gemma’s Bigger Bolder Baking

If mint is too mild next time: increase mint to 40 g or steep 15 minutes (but don’t boil hard).

For denser gelato: churn until thick, then pack tightly (less air pockets).

If it freezes too hard: next batch add 10–20 g more sugar (sugar helps softness)
