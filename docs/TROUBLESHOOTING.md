## Texture Problems

### ❄️ Icy/Grainy Texture

**Symptoms:** Gelato has visible ice crystals, feels icy on tongue, not smooth

**Causes & Solutions:**

| Cause | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **Base not cold enough before churning** | Chill base 12-24 hours, must be <4°C |
| **Ice cream maker bowl not frozen enough** | Freeze bowl 24 hours minimum |
| **Too much water, not enough fat/sugar** | Next batch: add 10g more sugar OR 50g more cream |
| **Churned too slowly or too long** | Churn until soft-serve consistency, no longer |
| **Temperature fluctuations in freezer** | Keep freezer constant at -18°C, don't open frequently |
| **Stored too long** | Consume within 2 weeks, crystals grow over time |
| **Custard not thick enough** | Ensure custard reaches 82-84°C and coats spoon |

**Prevention for next batch:**
- Ensure custard is properly thickened
- Chill thoroughly (overnight is best)
- Freeze bowl minimum 24 hours
- Churn efficiently (not too long)

### 🥚 Grainy/Lumpy (Scrambled Egg Texture)

**Symptoms:** Small lumps, grainy mouthfeel, curdled appearance

**Causes & Solutions:**

| Cause | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **Eggs scrambled - temperature too high** | Must stay between 82-84°C, use thermometer |
| **Eggs not properly tempered** | Gradually add 3 portions of hot liquid to eggs |
| **Heated too quickly** | Use medium-low heat, be patient |
| **Didn't stir constantly** | Stir constantly during custard cooking |

**If it happens:**
- Immediately strain through fine-mesh strainer
- Press through with spatula
- May save some smoothness
- If severe, unfortunately may need to start over

**Prevention:**
- Always use instant-read thermometer
- Temper eggs gradually (3 additions of hot liquid)
- Medium-LOW heat only
- Constant stirring
- Remove from heat at 83-84°C

### 🪨 Too Hard/Won't Scoop

**Symptoms:** Rock hard when frozen, difficult to scoop, hurts spoon

**Causes & Solutions:**

| Cause | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **Too much water, not enough sugar** | Next batch: add 10-20g more sugar |
| **Not enough fat** | Next batch: add 50g more cream |
| **Freezer too cold** | Store at -18°C (not colder) |
| **Not tempering before serving** | Let sit 5-10 minutes at room temp before serving |
| **Wrong ratio of ingredients** | Double-check measurements, use scale |

**Immediate fix:**
- Let sit at room temperature 10-15 minutes
- Run warm water on outside of scoop
- Store container in slightly warmer part of freezer

**Long-term fix:**
- Increase sugar by 10-20g in next batch
- This depresses freezing point, keeps gelato softer

## Flavor Issues

### 🌿 Mint Too Weak

**Symptoms:** Can barely taste mint, overwhelmed by chocolate

**Causes & Solutions:**

| Cause | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **Not enough mint** | Use 35-40g mint instead of 25-30g |
| **Didn't steep long enough** | Steep 15 minutes instead of 10 |
| **Mint not fresh** | Use very fresh, aromatic mint leaves |
| **Didn't tear/bruise leaves** | Gently tear leaves before steeping to release oils |
| **Too much chocolate** | Reduce chocolate slightly (use 80g instead of 100g) |

**Next batch:**
- Increase mint to 35-40g
- Tear mint leaves before adding to milk
- Steep for 15 minutes
- Taste test before straining

---

### 🌱 Mint Too Strong/Grassy/Bitter

**Symptoms:** Overpowering mint, grassy taste, bitter aftertaste

**Causes & Solutions:**

| Cause | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **Too much mint** | Use only 25g mint |
| **Steeped too long** | Steep only 8-10 minutes |
| **Mint boiled** | Keep below boiling, just steaming (75-80°C) |
| **Mint crushed too much** | Press gently when straining, don't pulverize |
| **Stems included** | Remove all stems, use only leaves |
| **Wrong mint variety** | Some mints are more aggressive |

**Prevention:**
- Never boil mint (causes bitterness)
- Steep only 10 minutes maximum initially
- Press gently when straining
- Remove all stems

---

### 🍫 Chocolate Too Weak

**Symptoms:** Not enough chocolate flavor, tastes mostly like mint

**Causes & Solutions:**

| Cause | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **Not enough chocolate** | Use 45g cocoa + 120g dark chocolate |
| **Low-quality chocolate** | Use good quality 60-70% dark chocolate |
| **Cocoa powder too mild** | Use Dutch-process for deeper flavor |
| **Chocolate not fully dissolved** | Whisk cocoa thoroughly, melt chocolate completely |

**Next batch:**
- Increase cocoa to 45g
- Increase chocolate to 120g
- Use high-quality dark chocolate (60-70% cacao)

---

### 🍬 Too Sweet

**Symptoms:** Overly sweet, cloying, sugar dominates

**Causes & Solutions:**

| Cause | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **Too much sugar** | Reduce sugar to 130-140g |
| **Chocolate too sweet** | Use 70% dark chocolate instead of 60% |
| **Too much sweet chocolate** | Reduce chocolate, increase cocoa powder |

**Note:** Don't reduce sugar below 130g or texture will suffer (too hard)

---

### 😐 Bland/Flat Flavor

**Symptoms:** Flavors don't "pop," tastes muted, unexciting

**Causes & Solutions:**

| Cause | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **Not enough salt** | Salt enhances all flavors - use full 1/4 tsp |
| **Serving too cold** | Serve at -12°C, let sit 5-10 min |
| **Base not aged** | Chill overnight (12-24 hours) for flavor development |
| **Low-quality ingredients** | Use fresh mint, good chocolate, whole milk |

**Quick fix:**
- Let gelato warm slightly before serving
- Add tiny pinch of sea salt on top when serving

---

## Consistency Problems

### 🌊 Separated/Curdled Appearance

**Symptoms:** Fat separated from mixture, curdled look, not smooth

**Causes & Solutions:**

|-------|----------|
| **Eggs scrambled** | See "Grainy texture" section above |
| **Chocolate seized** | Keep all utensils dry, melt chocolate in dairy |
| **Fat separated during storage** | Stir before serving, or let melt and refreeze |
| **Insufficient emulsification** | Ensure eggs are properly cooked (82-84°C) |

---

### 🍧 Crumbly/Sandy Texture

**Symptoms:** Falls apart, doesn't hold together, sandy feel

**Causes & Solutions:**

| Cause | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **Lactose crystallization** | Add 10g more sugar to prevent crystal formation |

**Causes & Solutions:**

| Cause | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **Too much air (overrun)** | Churn for shorter time |
| **Not enough fat** | Increase cream by 50g |
| **Too much sugar** | Reduce sugar by 10g |
| **Serving too warm** | Serve colder, don't temper as long |

---

## Appearance Issues

### 🟤 Color Too Light/Brown

**Symptoms:** Not dark chocolate color, looks muddy brown

**Causes & Solutions:**

| Cause | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **Not enough chocolate** | Increase dark chocolate and cocoa |
| **Natural cocoa used** | Use Dutch-process cocoa (darker) |
| **Too much dairy** | Within reason, slightly reduce milk |
| **Mint pieces left in** | Strain thoroughly |

---

### 🟢 Greenish Tint

**Symptoms:** Slight green color from mint

**Causes & Solutions:**

| Cause | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **Chlorophyll extracted** | Don't boil mint, steep at lower temp |
| **Mint crushed too much** | Press gently when straining |
| **Mint left in too long** | Steep maximum 15 minutes |

**Note:** Slight green tint is acceptable and shows real mint was used!

## Equipment Issues

### 🧊 Ice Cream Maker Not Working

**Problems & Solutions:**

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| **Bowl not cold enough** | Freeze 24+ hours, should be -18°C or colder |
| **Motor stops/struggles** | Gelato may be too thick, remove and freeze manually |
| **Not freezing at all** | Base may be too warm, chill more before churning |
| **Churning too long** | Most machines take 15-30 min, stop at soft-serve |

---

### 🌡️ No Thermometer

**Symptoms:** Don't have instant-read thermometer

**Alternative tests:**

**For custard (82-84°C):**
1. **Spoon coating test:** Dip spoon in custard, run finger through coating
   - Should leave clean line that doesn't run
2. **Steam test:** Should be steaming but not simmering/boiling
3. **Thickness:** Should have noticeably thickened from original liquid

**Warning:** Thermometer is highly recommended for consistent results!

---

## Storage Problems

### 🧊 Freezer Burn

**Symptoms:** Ice crystals on surface, dry spots, off-flavor

**Prevention:**
- Press plastic wrap directly on gelato surface
- Use airtight container
- Minimize freezer door openings
- Store in back of freezer (most stable temperature)
- Consume within 2 weeks

---

### 🧊 Absorbs Freezer Odors

**Symptoms:** Tastes like other freezer foods

**Prevention:**
- Airtight container is essential
- Double wrap: plastic wrap on surface + lid
- Keep away from strong-smelling foods
- Clean freezer regularly

---

### 🧊 Gets Harder Over Time

**Symptoms:** Starts scoopable, becomes rock hard after a week

**Causes:**
- Ice crystal growth over time (Ostwald ripening)
- Temperature fluctuations
- Natural process

**Solutions:**
- Can't fully prevent, but minimize by:
  - Constant freezer temperature
  - Airtight storage
  - Consume within 2 weeks
- Always temper 5-10 minutes before serving

## Diagnostic Flowchart

**Problem: Texture is wrong**

1. **Icy?** → Not enough fat/sugar OR temperature fluctuations
2. **Grainy/lumpy?** → Eggs scrambled (too hot)
3. **Too hard?** → Not enough sugar OR freezer too cold
4. **Too soft?** → Too much sugar OR not churned enough
5. **Crumbly?** → Over-churned OR lactose crystallization

**Problem: Flavor is wrong**

1. **Mint weak?** → More mint OR longer steep
2. **Mint strong/grassy?** → Less mint OR shorter steep OR mint boiled
3. **Chocolate weak?** → More cocoa/chocolate
4. **Too sweet?** → Less sugar OR darker chocolate
5. **Bland?** → More salt OR serve warmer

**Problem: Won't freeze**

1. **Too soft?** → More freezing time OR less sugar
2. **Melts fast?** → Less air OR more fat
3. **Never firms?** → Custard not thick enough OR too much sugar

## When to Start Over

Sometimes it's better to start fresh:

- **Severely scrambled eggs** → Strain won't fix it
- **Extremely wrong proportions** → Texture will be off
- **Burnt or bitter** → Can't remove burned flavor

## Success Checklist

Before you start, ensure you have:

- ✅ Instant-read thermometer
- ✅ Fresh mint (not dried)
- ✅ Good quality dark chocolate (60-70%)
- ✅ Ice cream maker bowl frozen 24+ hours
- ✅ Time to chill base 12-24 hours
- ✅ Time to freeze final product 2-4 hours

Follow the recipe precisely the first time, then adjust based on preferences!
