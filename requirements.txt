# Chocolate Mint Gelato Maker - Python Dependencies
# No external dependencies required - uses only Python standard library!

# The gelato_maker.py script uses only built-in modules:
# - time (for timing operations)
# - json (for saving batch logs)
# - datetime (for timestamps)
# - typing (for type hints)
# - dataclasses (for structured data)
# - enum (for step enumeration)

# All of these are included in Python 3.8+

# Optional: If you want to extend the script with these features:

# For advanced temperature monitoring (if connecting external thermometer):
# pyserial==3.5

# For plotting batch history:
# matplotlib==3.7.1

# For recipe scaling with fractions:
# fractions  # (built-in, no install needed)

# Python version requirement:
# Python >= 3.8
